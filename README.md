## Purpose

This is one Netflix desktop clone implementation.
The objectives are to show how it can be done and learn a few things in the process.

## Stack

ReactJS
NextJS
React Query
TypeScript

## Data source

Based on TMDB api.
The videos are mostly trailers sourced from youtube.

## Limitations

This is not a platform to watch movies. Therefore, the app is limited to the front page and all related interactions.
Only movies are shown, not TV shows.
For each category row, there is no loop scrolling yet (when you reach the end of the category). It requires moving poster nodes around.
